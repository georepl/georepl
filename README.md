# georepl

A Clojure program designed to let you do Constructive Geometry and combine your geometrical objects with the Clojure ecosystem using a Repl.

## Usage

The program uses quil (https://github.com/quil/quil). To start the framework call the main function in georepl/src/georepl/main.clj. Then connect with the port configured in georepl/src/georepl/configuration.clj using an nRepl client of your choice.
